1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was about creating a system to help people prepare for their driving tests. The client wanted an easy-to-use and secure online platform where users could access courses, track their progress, and get feedback.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I did a great job making the system simple to use and secure. I focused on designing a user-friendly interface that was easy to navigate and made sure that user data was well-protected.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the section about security. To improve it, I’d use even simpler language and add more visuals, like diagrams, to help explain the security features more clearly.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I focused on making the system easy to use and secure because that’s what the users needed most. It's important to consider user needs because if the system isn’t easy to use or doesn’t meet their expectations, it won’t be effective.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I start by understanding what the users need. I make sure the design is user-friendly and secure. In the future, I’ll continue using user-centered design and tools like diagrams to plan and improve the system step by step.
